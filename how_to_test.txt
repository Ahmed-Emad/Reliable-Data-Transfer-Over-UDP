- The project is built and compiled by IntelliJ IDEA 15 and java JDK 1.8

-  The main class is Main.java and the modifications must be done there

- Set the port number to work on in
        Networks.setPortNumber( 'port_number' );

- Select the mode you wish in
        Networks.setMode (Networks.Mode. 'mode' );
        ( you can choose from (StopAndWait, SelectiveRepeat, GoBackN) )

- Set the simulation server folder in
        PacketsManager.setServerPath( 'server_folder_path' );

- Set preferred window size in
        PacketsManager.setWindowSize( 'window_size' )
        ( if mode is "StopAndWait", then window size is ignored )

-  Set the packet size you prefer in
        PacketsManager.setPacketSize( 'packet_size' )
        ( maximum is 1024 )

-  Set preferred drop rate to simulate packet loss in
        PacketsManager.setDropRate( 'drop_rate' )

-  Set preferred wait time for every packet loss in
        PacketsManager.setWaitTime( 'wait_time' )

- For every client you wish to simulate just copy the code for first client and change
        String client'X'Name = 'name';
        UDPClient client1 = new UDPClient(client1Name,  'client_path' ,  'color_number' );
        client'X'.setRequestFile( 'file_name' );

        ( 'name' must be unique )
        ( 'client_path' to write client received files into )
        ( 'color_number' to identify client messages in terminal )
        ( 'file_name' the requested file name from server "the server must have this file" )
